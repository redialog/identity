redialog is a project that focuses on the iteration, updating, and revisiting of dialogues between systems (Machine to Machine, M2M) for the purpose of translating text into functional software, 

redialog describe any process that involves revisiting, updating, or iterating on the dialogue or conversation between a user and a system that translates text into functional software. 
While when codialog uses human interface, redialog uses Machine To Machine M2M interface



### Vision
