redialog is a project that focuses on the iteration, updating, and revisiting of dialogues between systems (Machine to Machine, M2M) for the purpose of translating text into functional software, 

redialog describe any process that involves revisiting, updating, or iterating on the dialogue or conversation between a user and a system that translates text into functional software. 
While when codialog uses human interface, redialog uses Machine To Machine M2M interface



### Vision
To redefine the capabilities of M2M communication, empowering systems to collaborate seamlessly and evolve through continuous dialogue, thus achieving unparalleled efficiency and innovation in automated software development.

### Mission
Redialog endeavors to deliver state-of-the-art M2M interface technology that streamlines the conversion of text into software, facilitating a perpetual cycle of improvement, learning, and adaptation in the digital fabric connecting our world.
